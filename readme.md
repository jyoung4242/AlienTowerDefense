  <h3 align="center">Alien Waves</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is a tower defense game based on the theme of Aliens. Your ship is stranded on an unknown alien planet and you must defend yourself from the waves of aliens that attack your ship!

You can click or touch the playing field to place defense turrets on the level to deal with the waves of Aliens that spawn.

Each level will increase in difficulty, so you really need to be wise regarding how you balance your wave funds between cheap turrets
and the expensive turrets.

There are no AI generated assets in this game. <br />
